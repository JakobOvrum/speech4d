speech4d Documentation
============================================
The *speech4d* documentation is generated using [bootDoc](https://github.com/JakobOvrum/bootDoc)
and can be viewed online [here](http://jakobovrum.github.com/speech4d/).

The documentation can be generated with the following command:

    rdmd bootDoc/generate.d ..

It assumes that the `speech` source package can be found as `../speech`, i.e.
it assumes that this directory is a subdirectory of the main *speech4d* branch.
The *speech4d* `.gitignore` has a `/docs` entry for this purpose.
